### 2.View Product:
- Retrieve a comprehensive view of all products by sending GET requests through Postman. This feature facilitates easy access to product details for quick reference.

### 3.Update Product:
- Modify existing product information using Postman's PUT requests. Update product attributes such as price, description, or quantity based on your business requirements.

### 4.Delete Product:
- Remove unwanted products from the system by sending DELETE requests through Postman. This ensures efficient product management and database cleanliness.
